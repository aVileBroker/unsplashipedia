# Unsplash...ipedia!
(Formerly Wikiphotos)

Yeah the name could use some work. It's all about viewing a big random set of photos from unsplash.com, and learning something about where they were taken!

The whole idea behind the project is that it should be built around 3 components, and I chose:

- An image slideshow
- A list for info cards
- The cards themselves (which also turn into modals if you click the + button)

There's also a tile view for quick navigation which can be scrolled - all with shared element animations. (they're not really shared, I just manage card position myself instead of relying on the browser)

# Installing

1) Clone the repo locally
3) run `npm install`
4) run `npm start`

And that's it! Make sure nothing is running on localhost:3000 or else there will be a collision.
